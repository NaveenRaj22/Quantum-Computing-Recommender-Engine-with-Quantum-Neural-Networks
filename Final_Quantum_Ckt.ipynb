This transformation maps the computational basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ onto their respective eigenstates √(|0>⊗∣1〉) and √(|0>⊗∣-1⟩), respectively. As a result, the H gate serves as a universal gate for performing superposition and entanglement operations. Additionally, the H gate plays a critical role in quantum algorithms for optimization, simulation, and machine learning."

It is useful because it allows us to conditionally affect another qubit without having to measure the control qubit. For example, say we wanted to swap the values of two qubits. We could do so using two CNOT gates, one controlling the first qubit and the other controlling the second qubit. If the control qubits were initially in the state |00>, the first CNOT would flip the value of the first qubit, giving us |01>. Then, the second CNOT would only operate on the second qubit if the first was still in the state |1>, thus swapping their values."
